### Short introduction of Shapley values

Shapley values are a concept in cooperative game theory that assigns a value to each player in a coalition game. They were introduced by Lloyd Shapley in 1953. The Shapley value measures the marginal contribution of each player to the worth of a coalition, taking into account all possible orderings of players. It provides a fair way to distribute the total value generated by a coalition among its members. The Shapley value has applications in various fields, including economics, political science, and machine learning.
